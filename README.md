# Course Description :
In this project, we are going to develop an AI chatbot using **AWS Lex** and **AWS Lambda**. The chatbot will be able to understand user queries based on whatever it has been trained on, and it will also be able to make **continued conversation** as it can remember important values from the conversation history. Users will also be provided with **options to select values using response cards**rather than typing each value. Using Lambda, we will connect the chatbot to **AWS DynamoDB** and read/write data from/to the db. At last, we will also be designing the **UI for chatbot** using lex API and will embed the chatbot on top of a webpage as an **iframe**.

# Final output of the project will be like -
